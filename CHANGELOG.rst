ManyMove – Changelog
========================

This is the repository-level changelog that summarizes notable changes across all packages.
Per-package changelogs may still be generated during release, but this file is the canonical
high-level history.

Forthcoming
-----------

- ``manymove_cpp_trees``: rename every BT executable's ROS node to match the
  binary name (``bt_client_xarm7``, ``bt_client_ur``, etc.) so source IDs are
  distinct on the ROS graph instead of all sharing ``bt_client_node``.
- ``manymove_cpp_trees``: hard dependency on ``ros2_medkit_fault_reporter``
  and ``ros2_medkit_msgs``. BT action nodes inherit a small ``FaultReporting``
  capability class and emit ``MANYMOVE_*`` fault codes on operational
  failures (collision, retry, robot-not-ready, IO failures, TF lookups,
  wait timeouts, FoundationPose timeouts). Catalogue in
  ``docs/FAULT_CODES.md``. Vanilla manymove users should stay on
  ``pastoriomarco/manymove``.
- ``manymove_cpp_trees``: drop unused ``topic_based_ros2_control`` declaration
  (still legitimately required by ``manymove_bringup``).

0.3.2 (2025-12-03)
------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^
- Keeps UR bringup working on Jazzy after upstream Robotiq changes by pruning the legacy activation controller and aligning xacro control flags with the new packages.
- Restores Humble gripper controller spawning by honoring the `gripper_include_ros2_control` toggle in the Robotiq xacro.
- Unblocks Jazzy CI and Docker builds by adding the Isaac ROS apt repository and ensuring `cppzmq`/ZeroMQ headers are present even when distro packages are missing.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

UR Robotiq bringup resilience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Removes the `robotiq_activation_controller` spawner from the UR fake-tree launchers and threads new simulation/control properties through `ur_with_robotiq.xacro` so Jazzy launches track the updated UR/Robotiq packages without crashing.
- Hooks the Robotiq xacro back up to `gripper_include_ros2_control`, restoring controller spawning on Humble while keeping Jazzy simulation toggles consistent.

Jazzy container and CI dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Adds the Isaac ROS apt repository in both the Dockerfile and CI when targeting Jazzy so `topic-based-ros2-control` and related packages resolve during builds.
- Ensures ZeroMQ headers are available in the bringup image by installing `libzmq3-dev` and falling back to building `cppzmq` from source when the distro package is unavailable, keeping Groot compilation working across runners.

0.3.1 (2025-11-13)
------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^
- Updates the ROSCon 2025 FR+DE workshop guide plus the color-signal demo assets so docs and
  BehaviorTree examples stay aligned.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

ROSCon 2025 FR+DE Universal Robots demos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Polishes `manymove_cpp_trees/src/bt_client_ur.cpp` so the UR pick/place flows mirror the
  external package's `manymove_color_signal/src/bt_client_ur_color_signal.cpp` content.

0.3.0 (2025-11-12)
------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^
- Switches both manipulator actions to `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`, eliminating the implicit
  MoveIt dependency from `manymove_msgs`, downstream planners, and behavior-tree clients.
- Keeps `manymove_planner` behavior identical by translating to `moveit_msgs::msg::RobotTrajectory`
  internally, preserving diagnostics/logging while presenting a leaner public API.
- Adds `MANYMOVE_COLCON_WORKERS` across Dockerfiles, run scripts, and `setup_workspace.sh` so
  developers and CI can cap `colcon`/CMake concurrency; polishes docs/tutorials accordingly.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Manipulator actions now depend only on core ROS 2 interfaces - Planner compatibility preserved
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Rewrites `PlanManipulator` and `MoveManipulator` to exchange
  `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`, removing the transitive `moveit_msgs` dependency from
  `manymove_msgs` (`manymove_msgs/action/*.action`) and slimming `package.xml` requirements.
- Updates `manymove_cpp_trees` nodes/tests to pass JointTrajectory objects through the blackboard,
  drops MoveIt headers from the tree helpers, and refreshes build/run dependencies so downstream
  BehaviorTree clients remain lightweight.
- Adjusts `manymove_planner` to deserialize the slimmer action goals, convert them back to
  `moveit_msgs::msg::RobotTrajectory` internally, and keep all existing scoring, diagnostics, and
  rejection paths intact for MoveIt-based pipelines.

Docker and workspace tooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Threads the `MANYMOVE_COLCON_WORKERS` environment variable through
  `Dockerfile.manymove(_xarm)`, `run_manymove(_xarm)_container.sh` and
  `docker/scripts/setup_workspace.sh` so container builds, Groot compilation, and overlay rebuilds
  can stay within a deterministic worker budget.
- Documents the new knob in `manymove_bringup/docker/README.md`, clarifying how the limit also
  drives `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` when present.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixes the first `manymove_cpp_trees` tutorial solution so the example behavior tree matches the
  intended flow after the action refactor.

Breaking changes / migration notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Update any custom clients, launch files, or BehaviorTree nodes that consumed
  `moveit_msgs::msg::RobotTrajectory` directly from the manipulator actions to the new
  `trajectory_msgs::msg::JointTrajectory` fields.
- Consumers that still need full `moveit_msgs::msg::RobotTrajectory` objects can convert the action
  payload locally or query the planner nodes, but the public action API is now MoveIt-free.

0.2.2 (2025-11-07)
------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^
- Hardens the MoveIt planners with richer trajectory scoring, diagnostics, and multi-turn joint safeguards.
- Refreshes the Universal Robots launchers and configs so MoveGroup/MoveItCpp demos share the same pipeline defaults across Jazzy and Humble.
- Streamlines developer containers and bootstrap scripts with Groot installation, UR/Robotiq dependencies, and optional sudo workflows.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Planner diagnostics and trajectory quality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Introduces the shared ``trajectory_utils`` helpers so both planners can evaluate candidate paths on duration, TCP motion, and accumulated rotation before selecting a winner.
- Logs detailed joint-limit and collision reasons whenever MoveIt rejects a trajectory, making it easier to track down invalid waypoints.
- Detects multi-revolution joint wraparounds plus duplicate joint targets to avoid dispatching stale solutions and to fall back cleanly when the robot sits near joint limits.

Universal Robots launchers and configs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Reworks the ``ur_movegroup_fake_cpp_trees`` and ``ur_moveitcpp_fake_cpp_trees`` launchers so pipeline arrays, controller selection, and fake hardware toggles are parsed consistently between MoveGroup and MoveItCpp demos.
- Adds the Humble-friendly ``ompl_planning.legacy.yaml`` and wires in the upstream ``ur_moveit_config`` dependency so legacy adapters remain available while Jazzy defaults stay untouched.
- Updates the C++ UR behavior-tree client to share planner knobs (planner IDs, plan budgets, pose builders) across the pick/place sequences, keeping the demos repeatable on hardware or simulation.

Developer containers and bootstrap scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Extends the Dockerfile and run scripts to optionally grant sudo inside the container, rebuild all layers on demand, and propagate workspace UID/GID overrides.
- Adds ``docker/scripts/setup_workspace.sh`` which builds Groot from source (with pinning support), runs rosdep, and performs a ``colcon build`` as the unprivileged user.
- Ensures UR and Robotiq dependencies are preinstalled in the bringup images so fake-tree bringup and MoveIt demos work out of the box.

0.2.0 (2025-10-20)
------------------

Summary
^^^^^^^
- First ManyMove release promoted from `dev` to the new `main` branch.
- Aligns the full stack for ROS 2 Humble and Jazzy while standardizing documentation,
  packaging, and quality gates.

Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

Unified manipulation command stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Introduces a single ``MoveManipulator`` action that covers planning and execution across
  planner servers, behavior-tree clients, and message definitions.
- Streamlines action handling with improved preemption, logging, and validation, while updating
  Docker/Isaac ROS flows and tutorials to the unified interface.

Behavior tree libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Expands the BehaviorTree.CPP node catalog, improves HMI integration/logging, and adds
  walkthrough tutorials and example clients.
- Refreshes the Python behavior-tree examples to the new ``MoveManipulator`` action with linting,
  formatting, and unit-test coverage improvements.

Object and scene management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Enhances object manager actions for adding/removing/attaching objects, clarifies result messages,
  and refreshes referenced assets and meshes.
- Revises the message package to centralize custom interfaces and decouple legacy dependencies.

Operator experience and bringup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Updates HMI widgets with stronger validation, additional field types, and clearer feedback for
  runtime status flows.
- Delivers new and refined launchers (single- and dual-robot demos), sequential bringup scripts,
  and Docker/Isaac ROS helpers that keep example pipelines reproducible.

Tooling and quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Standardizes READMEs and maintainer metadata across packages.
- Establishes pre-commit style automation with `ruff`, `isort`, and Uncrustify profiles that pass
  on Humble (0.72) and Jazzy (0.78), tightening CI plus `colcon test` coverage.
- Applies broad formatting, license, and minimum CMake updates to keep the codebase consistent.

Breaking changes / deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- **Behavior/Planner action unification**: the previous split between “plan” and “execute” actions
  is replaced by ``MoveManipulator`` and the updated behavior-tree nodes/clients. Update any custom
  integrations that relied on the legacy actions.

Migration notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Replace references to legacy plan/execute actions with the new ``MoveManipulator`` action.
- Review launchers, parameter names, and tutorials: several examples were normalized during the
  unification effort.
- Install and use the provided formatting/linting hooks so local results match CI expectations.
